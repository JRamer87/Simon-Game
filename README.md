# Simon-Game
A recreation of the original Simon game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game).

# Goal
To re-create the Simon memory game from my childhood.  The game has four buttons that light up in random sequence and you have to hit the buttons in the same order that they lit up to keep progressing.  As soon as you get one wrong you have to start over.  I want the app to have a retro feel just like the original game.
